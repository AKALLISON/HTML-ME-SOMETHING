<h1><u>My Top Three Favorite Movies</u></h1cd>
<h1> Number Three</h1>
<img src = "Photos/Predator.jpg">
<p>I am a huge fan of science fiction! I've seen several shows and movies but there are three that are at the top of my list. My third favorite film is Predator. I never get tired of watching this film. It starred Arnold Schwarzenegger and was directed by John McTiernan. There have been other spin off films made, but the original one is the best. That's not just my opinion, it's fact!  </p>

<h2> Number Two</h2>

<p>The next on the list is a classic, and it's actually a collection of films, but they need to be viewed as a set. It's the Star Wars Trilogy. The films were created and directed by George Lucas. The first of these films came out in the 70's but they continue to impact popular culture and inspire other films today. And yes you can like Star Trek too. </p>

<h1> Number One</h1>

<p>So far I've listed two of the top science fiction films produced, but there is one that always takes top place for me. My number one film choice is Alien. It features Sigourney Weaver as the lead character and director Ridley Scott. Both of the artists consistenly create great work, so it's no wonder that they were able to collsborate together and produce a classic movie that has withstood time.</p>
